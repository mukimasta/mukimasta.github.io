### **★★★ Product Design – Electronic Music** (2025)

This is my final project for the FPGA course. I designed a electronic chord instrument on FPGA, so that I can play music on a computer keyboard. The inspiration is from an e-music product called Liberlive guitar. I wrote almost all codes for my design. I love my design and hope to improve this product in the future.

I composed this string quartet during my spare time at university. I started this E minor piece with a motif inspired by my feeling to Northwestern China–vast and a bit desolate. I tried to narrate my college life through this piece. I turned it into a video presented in the form of a Vlog.

This is a video recording of me playing ‘Romance’ with my friend at university. I was on the piano, wearing a yellow hoodie. I always enjoy every moment of making music together.

This is my exploration of improvisation. I experimented with complex chords for a piece of the famous Chinese song, ‘The Moon Represents My Heart.’
