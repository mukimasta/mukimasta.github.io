## Hanlin Xue

M.S. Student in ECE @ University of Washington  
Seeking Summer 2026 internship | Robotics & ML Engineer

My work focuses on **Robotics and Machine Learning Engineering**. I'm enthusiastic about building intelligent systems that work in the real world.

Most recently, I participated in an autonomous driving project. We integrated the entire system, enabling the car to localize itself, plan a path, and physically drive to a destination selected by user.

Previously, I was a Robotics Algorithm Intern at MagicLab Robotics Technology, where I fine-tuned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for humanoid robot manipulation.

In 2024, I conducted research at the AIR Lab, Tsinghua University, where I designed an open-vocabulary perception system for robotic grasping.
