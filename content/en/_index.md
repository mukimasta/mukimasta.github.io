## Hanlin Xue


I am currently a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Washington. Seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities in Software/Robotics.

My work focuses on robotics and AI—specifically building intelligent systems that work in the real world.

Previously, I was a Robotics Algorithm Intern at MagicLab Robotics Technology, where I fine-tuned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and deployed them on humanoid robot manipulators.

In 2024, I conducted research at the AIR Lab, Tsinghua University, where I designed open-vocabulary robotic grasping systems.
